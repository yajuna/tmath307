# tmath307
This repository contains the labs for TMATH 307; you can find all jupyter notebooks here. 

If you have local version of these softwares, feel free to use your own machine to work on the labs. Please check your version in requirements.txt and runtime.txt. You will need to install jupyter notebook in a virtual environment, and you can find all relevant instructions in the file commands in this repository for Ubuntu os, probably with small modification for Mac os. Let me know if you are interested in installing in Windows os and have trouble.

The following is optional. The purpose is to make sure we work with the same versions of softwares and therefore get same outputs (i.e., to make our experiments reproducible), and save you from the installations mentioned above. You do not need to use Binder to run the labs, but you do need to use Jupyter notebook.

....> Update: click below for JupyterLab via Binder!

It might take a few minutes for the jupyter notebook to open up. You can read the Build log while waiting. The jupyter notebook prompted by binder will deactivate after 10 minutes if you do not do anything with it, and you would lose your work. I suggest you fork the repo if you have a github account; or download if you do not.
